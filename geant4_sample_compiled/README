#For HeppRApp visualization tool
This is one of the lightest, fastest and easiest to use vizualization tools (The other like OpenInventor, QT and so on are more complex and harder to understand)
I like this one better, if I need visualization of simulated detector events on-the-go.

Ref:
http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/Presentations/vis/G4HepRAppTutorial/G4HepRAppTutorial.html

To get:
$ wget http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~perl/HepRApp/HepRApp.jar
To run (make sure java is installed on system):
$ java -jar HepRApp.jar
From there it will open up a drop-down menu and you can choose your output simulated events and visualize the tracks (if you specify the visual options at runtime).
